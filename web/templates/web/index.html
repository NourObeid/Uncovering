            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Experiences of the First World War could be profoundly[HD2] different, depending on the location and type
                of deployment[HD3] or military unit, stage of the war, medical issues, social class and more. This
                broader project seeks to provide more context for the experiences of different military units in
                different locations and different stages of the war. In histories, memoirs, diaries, correspondence and
                images about a given military unit (e.g. a battalion), what places are mentioned most, and is said about
                them - how are they described or discussed?.</p>
