            <p>Experiences of the First World War could be profoundly[HD2] different, depending on the location and type
                of deployment[HD3] or military unit, stage of the war, medical issues, social class and more. This
                broader project seeks to provide more context for the experiences of different military units in
                different locations and different stages of the war. In histories, memoirs, diaries, correspondence and
                images about a given military unit (e.g. a battalion), what places are mentioned most, and is said about
                them - how are they described or discussed?.</p>
            <p>• Experiences of the First World War could be thoroughly different, depending on the location, type of
                military unit, medical issues, social class and more. We aim to provide more context for the experiences
                of different military units in different locations of the war and seek to find the connections among
                them.


            <p>• We are collaborating with the British Library, text-mining and geo-referencing on a large collection of
                digitised books provided by the British Library.</p>


            <p>• We need to apply machine learning, corpus linguistics and sentiment analysis techniques to identify and
                generate a gazetteer of the names of places within digitised publications from and about the First World
                War</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>We have a range of gazetteers to choose; It is difficult to find a source that provides a perfect
                gazetteer
                for the domain of WW1 so it is necessary to experiment with different gazetteers before deciding which
                one
                to use. They are:

                Genomes: covers all countries and contains over eleven million place-names, the drawback is some
                historical
                place-names will not be identified
                Deep: historical place names in England
                Pleiades+: a community build gazetteer of ancient places
                Unlock: a general gazetteer mainly for the UK


                The system should be able to identify people names as well. It is found that identifying place names and
                person names at the same time would increase the accuracy of differentiating some ambiguous places. For
                example, ‘Levis’ could be a first name or an island in Scotland. As well as “Mrs Chesterfield”, “Earl of
                Essex”.

                Local gazetteers are important on improving the speed of processing large files. Comparing to use online
                gazetteer services, setting up a local database of storing the gazetteers is more desirable.

                Process Pipeline

                The specified text file is going through a series of processing steps which are combined into one
                pipeline.
                It is first tokenised, part-of-speech tagged and lemmatised. After these initial steps, named entity
                recognition is performed to identify location and person names as well as dates. Finally, visualisations
                are
                created to be able to inspect the file and the Geoparser output using a map interface in a browser.

                1. Tokenization: It identifies word tokens and results in w elements being wrapped around the tokens and
                wraps s elements around the sentences

                2. Part-of-speech tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a
                particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.

                3. Lemmatization is the process of finding the stem form of inflected words.
